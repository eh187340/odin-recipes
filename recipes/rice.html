        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Egg fried rice is an absolute staple, quick to make,
            relatively healthy, and very filling (and delicious).
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Long grain rice</li>
            <li>Spring onions</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, get your rice on the boil. Use a large pan
                and always wash your rice first. 
            </li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, drain and rinse with 
                cold water.
            </li>
            <li>Finely slice your spring onions, and mince the
                garlic.
            </li>
            <li>Heat your wok until smoking. Add your sesame oil.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and spring onions and stir fry until
                fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>Add the rice to the wok and stir constantly.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is warmed through, push to the side and
                crack the eggs in. Quickly mix the eggs to prevent them
                frying. Once set like a small omelette, you can chop them 
                with your spoon and mix into the rice.
            </li>
            <li>Add a splash of soy sauce to your liking and mix well.</li>
            <li>Voila!</li>
        </ol>
